## Hi, I’m Suleman 👋

I’m building **AI-powered financial intelligence systems** focused on
**capital movement, insider behavior, and long-term market signals**.

### 🧠 Why This Matters
In the next 5–10 years, markets will not reward speed alone.
They will reward **intelligence, pattern recognition, and capital behavior analysis**.

Retail trades react.
Funds anticipate.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- AI-driven capital flow analysis
- Insider-like movement detection
- On-chain & off-chain financial signal modeling
- Long-term fund intelligence systems

### 🎯 Vision
To build transparent, AI-powered tools that help
**investors, funds, and institutions** understand *where capital is moving before price reacts*.

### 📌 Status
Early-stage builder | Research-first | Long-term vision
